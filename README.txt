Hello,

My webapplication is like skype 
but runs in the browser.

For now the code is open source but
I can imagine to do commercial 
with this project. I am not sure yet.

Why did I publish it with github?
Because I want to get better in
programming(JSP, JavaScript,...).
I am interested in feedback on my
code.

If you are interested to connect 
up my project you are welcome.

Just send me an email: 
kenan_1989_22@hotmail.de

If so don`t forget to download
sql.sql file, too. Because with
it you can create all needed tables
and example inserts, too.
